My Personal Website

Welcome you're viewing the source code for my personal website. I use this to promote myself online like a common joe.

website can be based off open source code but the actual "open source" code for the
website is not provided.

Under the AGPLV3 that this software is licensed under you must ensure that the source 
code that you are using is made publicly available and accessible to everyone. In the
case of the Free Room Finder Website a URL to this GitHub page where the source code 
can be obtained is provided in the footer of the website.
